# open-lectures
Prototype for a web platform that aggregates free and public university lectures available on platforms like YouTube

Plan is basically to make an interactive version of the following list:
https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suradnik:Danijel.Korent/Popis_besplatnih_i_javno_dostupnih_sveu%C4%8Dili%C5%A1nih_video_predavanja

(P.S. I'm not a web developer and I have no idea what I'm doing)

Latest version is on-line here:
